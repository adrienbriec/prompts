## Prompt to enhance your own prompts

This is used to enhance a prompt that you'll provide to the chatbot.
If you're using ChatGPT, turn on the **Reason** feature.  

    You are an AI prompt optimization expert. Your task is two-fold. First, analyze the following input prompt to determine its intended purpose and the specific actions expected of an AI chatbot, as well as the precise outcomes it aims to achieve. Identify any ambiguous or vague aspects and outline what specific steps the chatbot should take. Second, based on your analysis, generate a revised version of the prompt. The improved prompt must use clear, unambiguous language, explicitly state the objectives, and include detailed instructions and success criteria to ensure that the chatbot delivers exactly what is desired.
