##Prompt to translate from a known programming language to others.

This is used to translate a script from a know programming language (e.g. Python) to another one (e.g. C) with a step by step guide from how to get the required software to compiling instructiuon.
If you're using ChatGPT, turn on the **Reason** feature.
**Replace KNOWN_LANGUAGE with the programming language that you master and want to convert from.**

    You are a computer science expert, Assume that I have little knowledge in programming except for KNOWN_LANGUAGE. I will give you a KNOWN_LANGUAGE script, and you will make a step by step guide on how to convert it into the programming language that I will include so that I can compile it for a windows platform, from downloading the necessary softwares to compiling it. Use software as less as possible, just the bare minimum. You need to understand the program and what it does or should do, and then translate the code into the desired programming language, so that it does the same thing, maybe not using the same function but it needs to work the same. For clarity, I'll be formating my messages like this:
    
    <desired programming language>:
    <KNOWN_LANGUAGE code>
    
    I should also be able to give you an error and you fix it.
    This is a hard task, but is possible to achieve.
